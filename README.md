Siamak's learning journal

Day 2 was really awesome and I wasnâ€™t confused. However in day 3 when we got to loops and arrays I lost my path. More importantly whatever I did to keep a tally of numbers I could just get it in console.log not anywhere els.
I should practice more. I wish the basics for a beginner where also practiced in the class with more details, cause they are all new to me.

Learning journal day 5:
First week went really well. On Tuesday I freaked out about coding cause I did not get what I needed to do. But it went better the following days. I learnt about pseudo coding and how to put arithmetics together. Also git hub seems very interesting and useful. I learnt a lot about it this week. It is getting more tangible to me as time is going. Arrays, loops and functions are cool stuff. Cant wait for the second week. I need to work more on CSS.


Day 6 so far the hardest day for me. I learned some about DOM but I really have not got the logic of putting codes in JS to be able to be shown in HTML, especially, sum and if it is 2 columns. hope will be worked on in the class.
