Siamak's learning journal

Day 2 was really awesome and I wasnâ€™t confused. However in day 3 when we got to loops and arrays I lost my path. More importantly whatever I did to keep a tally of numbers I could just get it in console.log not anywhere els.
I should practice more. I wish the basics for a beginner where also practiced in the class with more details, cause they are all new to me.

Learning journal day 5:
First week went really well. On Tuesday I freaked out about coding cause I did not get what I needed to do. But it went better the following days. I learnt about pseudo coding and how to put arithmetics together. Also git hub seems very interesting and useful. I learnt a lot about it this week. It is getting more tangible to me as time is going. Arrays, loops and functions are cool stuff. Cant wait for the second week. I need to work more on CSS.


Day 6 so far the hardest day for me. I learned some about DOM but I really have not got the logic of putting codes in JS to be able to be shown in HTML, especially, sum and if it is 2 columns. hope will be worked on in the class.


Day 8
Probably the hardest days so far for me. But the good thing is after 2 days I got the idea how to start writing codes, basically do small parts when it is done move to next step. I learned constructor, render, event, how to make html in JS.
SO far so good.

Day 10
I learnt useful html and css patterns, plus organizing wireframes. In addition, I learned to be focused on details, cause I was working on wireframes for more than 3 hours but nothing changed, I could not find what was wrong but it was only because I didnt link html and css pages. The hardest part in my mind is putting boxes or elements wherever you want with keeping the desired sizes. Cant wait to learn more about css. I also figured out the best way of learning coding is to see sample codes and read more about details before starting your project.

Day 11
Well, this is a hard week and the week of do something without knowing it. It is a little bit frustrating to do something you have no idea about. I think this is a little weird. I should look more on learning on my own. I learnt some ideas about  constructor and event listener but still seem unknown.

Day 13
We learnt some good stuff about charts and local storage. A review on constructors.

Day 15
A lot of stuff to manage in teamwork and handle everything together. The thing I learnt this week was basically to stick to what is scheduled as a group and achieve the set goals first. I also learnt a lot of good stuff about git. Project seems to be really interactive and useful as long as you are using what you have learnt and you want to see how to put stuff together to be able to achieve what you desire.
