Day 2 was really awesome and I wasnâ€™t confused. However in day 3 when we got to loops and arrays I lost my path. More importantly whatever I did to keep a tally of numbers I could just get it in console.log not anywhere els.
I should practice more. I wish the basics for a beginner where also practiced in the class with more details, cause they are all new to me.
